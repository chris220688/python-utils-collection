# Useful Python Utils

This is a collection of Python snippets.

Some of them are code read in books, practice material, or boilerplates I might be using regularly.

### Usage

The modules are standalone, thus you don't need the whole repository.

Just copy paste..

### Tips

There are quite a few print statements, mainly used to explain how the code works or point out the flow of execution.

### Acknowledgements
