# Useful Python Utils

This is a collection of re-usable Python utility scripts.

### Usage

The modules are standalone, thus you don't need the whole repository.

Just pick up the module you like and add it in you project.

Then import the functions you need and enjoy.

### Tips

At the bottom of each module there is a commented out section with examples.
Uncomment it and run the module for a quick demo.
